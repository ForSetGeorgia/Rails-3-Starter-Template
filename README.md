# JumpStart Bootstrap Starter Project

The Bootstrap Starter project is a Ruby on Rails project with Bootstrap 3, Devise authorization and the most commonly used gems already installed and ready to go.  This is a short description on how to use this repo as the start of a new project.

* On your machine, in projects folder, create folder for new project
* cd into folder and run:
      * git clone git@github.com:JumpStartGeorgia/Bootstrap-Starter.git .
* the new project does not need to include all of the git history from the bootstrap starter project. So do the following to start git over from scratch:
      * rm -rf .git
      * git init
      * git add -A
      * git commit -am ‘_________’
* push new project to repo for first time
      * go to github and copy the clone url for the new project
      * run: 
            * git remote add origin [clone url here]
            *git push -u origin master
